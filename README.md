CS411 - Group 3 - NearBUY

##About:
NearBuy allows people to "check in” to their current location to help nearby friends who request a "shopping list" to get items from that specific store or location. It will be cheaper than any other delivery APP (ex: Favor or DoorDash) because the carrier does not go to that location for purpose of completing the customer’s request. They go there simply to shop/buy their own stuff while conveniently checking if there is anyone around them who also need things from that location. People who use NearBuy get to be the delivery-man and customer at the same time. They can earn cash by completing others’ requests or pay others for their services. NearBuy will be able to work in various locations, such as restaurants, movie theatres, retail stores, supermarkets, etc. 

##Examples of Use:
*restaurant: order food for take out
*movie theater: buy tickets for later movie times
*retail stores: buy basic necessities
*supermarkets: buy grocery items

##Scenario:
I need to get some necessity from Target, but I want to make some extra cash. I can log into the app, check in my current location and note how long I will stay here. While I am here, nearby friends can request me to purchase something for them. I have the ability to accept their request, receive a payment, and deliver the items.
